After being inspired by a YouTube video on wood working i wanted to create something special for the skirts on the Voron V0 printer.
After many hours of design i found two patterns that looked the way i was hoping for.
The patterns have been made that they are one line width so giving a delicate look.

I have Paired this style up with my own version of Skirt Fans.
These do not have to be printed if you would not like to have them.
Simply print 2 x of the normal Side Skirts to complete.

I hope you enjoy these new designs.
