# Voron_V0.2r1_Kumiko_Skirts
Kumiko inspired patterned skirts for the Voron V0

After being inspired by a YouTube video on wood working i wanted to create something special for the skirts on the Voron V0 printer.
After many hours of design i found two patterns that looked the way i was hoping for.
The patterns have been made that they are one line width so giving a delicate look.

I hope you enjoy these new designs.
